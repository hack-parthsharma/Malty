### Malty

Ever wanted to merge two Maltego configuration files into one? Now you can!

I've created a lot of transforms/entities/machines for our iTDS and linked them to our seed via a Paired Configration (an exported Maltego mtz configuration file). Now if I want to add just one more entity to this, I have to re-export and select each item one by one.

This script allows me to just export the new configuration items, and merge it with the previous configuration mtz file.

If none of this made any sense, the tool's not for you.
